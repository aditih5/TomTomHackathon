# TomTomHackathon
We developed an out-of-the-box solution for our day-to-day problems, which improves the security of TomTom users while also allowing us to build a trustful relationship with them. We used Tom Tom SDKs and APIs to help us implement our world-class solution. We implemented a splendid idea that lowers the volume of a third-party music player (Spotify). It assists the user in retaining focus on the road while driving at high speeds.
Another brilliant idea was a map for aspiring drivers. This functionality allows nervous newbies to find safer roads with less or no traffic and open space where the driver can learn driving safely, ensuring the safety of the users and other road users. We used the TomTom API to create search operations on the map and find appropriate areas for driving practitioners. Another feature is the option to add markers to the map by double clicking on it. This enables us to devise a route between the selected markers so that the driver can practice without getting lost or losing his/her way.
All these are unique solutions to solve problems of tom tom users and strengthen their security and safety on the go
